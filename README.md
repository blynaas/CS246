# CC3K
CS246 final project with Yaro Gorban (blynaas)

This is a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, created by me (Jordan Verasamy) and blynaas (Yaro Gorban) for CS246 Assignment 5 at the University of Waterloo. Fight enemies, gather gold, and try to reach the top floor! Your character is denoted by the `@` symbol. Move by typing a direction (no, ea, so, we, ne, nw, se, sw). Attack by typing `a <direction>`, for example `a ea` to attack the tile to the east. Use potions (denoted by `P` on the map) with the command `u <direction>`. Your goal is to make it to the top floor with as much gold as possible.


To run, type `make`, then `cc3k` while in the CC3K directory. Optionally, append a filename to the `cc3k` command to read in a map file. (For examples of what map files should look like, take a look at  examplefloor.in, weirdMap.in, and defaultMap.in in the repository.)
